## Let's Begin

```
There are two main states of attacker mindset: 
There’s before the vulnerable information has been carved out and there’s after.

One commonality exists between them: 
Every step you take as an attacker must go in the direction of the objective.
```

```
Things to remember:
```
- ***There is no attack without information as an example:*** 
- ***If you hear of a company holding a conference, you may be able to phish them by gathering information on who their vendors are, what their employees are doing and what their security is like.***
- ***You can then use this information to create a convincing phishing email that will be more likely to be opened.***
- ***If they are holding the event virtually, a well-crafted phish will have a high probability of being undetected.***
- ***You might start by finding out which platform they are holding the event on and phishing them, pretending to be that platform.***
- ***The possibilities are truly endless when you have information, and you can weaponize it and leverage it correctly.***

## Cognitive Skills

```
All of this neatly brings us to the cognitive skills an attacker must exhibit:
```
- ***An attacker must have curiosity & persistence to drive that curiosity into action so as to be moving forward all the time.***
- ***This mindset requires self-awareness.***
- ***Self-awareness is invisible. No one can “see” that you are self-aware, but almost everyone can feel if you are or not.***
- ***An attacker’s main ammo is the leveraging and weaponization of information, without this they are powerless.***
- ***Never forget that the world runs on data now, so information is everywhere, You just need to know how to find it and how to use it.***

```
It’s the application of the skills against the laws that makes the mindset:
```
- ***The first law of AMs states that you start with the end in mind, knowing your objective. This will allow you to use laws 2, 3, and 4 most effectively.***
- ***Law 2 states that you gather, weaponize, and leverage information for the good of the objective, this is how you serve law 1.***
- ***Law 3 says that you never break pretext. You must remain disguised as a threat at all times.***
- ***Law 4 tells you that everything you do is for the benefit of the objective.***
```
The objective is the central point from which all moves an attacker makes is dependent on it.
```

## Things to remember

```
These five things play a role in every job you will get as an ethical attacker looking to succeed.
```
- ***You cannot become a good attacker without a healthy dose of curiosity.***
- ***Your curiosity will not pay off without persistence.***
- ***You will have nothing to persist in if you cannot take in information and leverage the most of it correctly.***
- ***You will need to have mental agility (seeing the big picture) to actively adapt information in the moment.***
- ***If you have all of these skills, you will still only succeed if you have a high level of self-awareness, because you must always know what you bring and how to leverage it.*** 
- ***Self-awareness will allow you a higher level of influence over someone else which helps in social engineering.***
- ***Reporting attacks are for most people the least fun part of the job but the most important part for the client.***
```
Key Note:  War is 90 percent information, the rest is how you apply it to the objective.
```

## [Application of mindset](https://github.com/smadi0x86/CSC-RedOps/blob/main/Start/0x1-Mindset/Objective.png)

```
The application is the leveraging of that information to perform our attack, Let’s look at application from a high level.
There are many ways to attack:
```

- ***Physical Attacks: An attack on a physical resource, such as a facility, building, or other physical asset.***
- ***Human Attack: An attack that involves social engineering and the manipulation of people to achieve the objective, also at a physical resource/facility, includes vishing (voice phishing).***
- ***Cyber Attacks: Cyberattacks can range from installing spyware or malware onto a computer or network to attempting to destroy the infrastructure.***
- ***Theoretical Attacks: Often used for strategy and decision making, It is typically performed by two opposing teams, generally outside the organization, that test the weight of the intelligence given to them, both arriving at different outcomes based on the same information.***
