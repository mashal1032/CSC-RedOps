## Let's Begin

```
There are two main states of attacker mindset: 
There’s before the vulnerable information has been carved out and there’s after.

One commonality exists between them: 
Every step you take as an attacker must go in the direction of the objective.
```

```
Things to remember:
```
- ***There is no attack without information as an example:*** 
- ***If you hear of a company holding a conference, you may be able to phish them by gathering information on who their vendors are, what their employees are doing and what their security is like.***
- ***You can then use this information to create a convincing phishing email that will be more likely to be opened.***
- ***If they are holding the event virtually, a well-crafted phish will have a high probability of being undetected.***
- ***You might start by finding out which platform they are holding the event on and phishing them, pretending to be that platform.***
- ***The possibilities are truly endless when you have information, and you can weaponize it and leverage it correctly.***
