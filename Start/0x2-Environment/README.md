## Pick your distribution
- ***Picking your linux distro is essential to ensure that you're comfortable and doing your attacks with full efficiency***
```
There are many distros you can pick from, some popular ones are:
```
- [***Kali Linux***](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/)
- [***ParrotOS***](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/)
- [***BlackArch***](https://blackarch.org/downloads.html)

```
We will not go over installing them, but here are videos that explains that:
```
- [***Installing Kali***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Iq7wHsNEXw)
- [***Installing Parrot***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z-_h7aChDI)
- [***Installing BlackArch***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0MBlWLZvpE)

## Command Line Fun

```
I will be explaining terminal commands that is handy for offensive ops, meanwhile I'm assuming you know basics of terminal usage such as: cd, cat, grep, chmod etc...
```
```
Note: These commands are tested on Parrot and Kali, BlackArch terminal is slightly different, it uses pacman instead of apt for package managing for example.
```
